# Delete old packages

Github action for deleting old versions of packages in the Github package registry.

This is very similar to [actions/delete-package-versions](https://github.com/actions/delete-package-versions)
but targets a different use case.

The action works by getting at most 20 packages with at most the oldest 100 versions,
applying either the `version` or `version-pattern` and `keep` filters on them and then deleting the matching versions.

> If you have more than 100 versions and none of the 100 oldest versions match, no packages will be deleted!

### Example usage
